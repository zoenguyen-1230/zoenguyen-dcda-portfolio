            <!-- TODO: Write a brief introduction (2-3 sentences) about your portfolio -->
            <p>Welcome to my DCDA capstone portfolio, where I explore how culture, media, and data come together in digital spaces. Throughout the semester, this site will feature my projects, process, and experiments using both creative and analytical tools. My goal is to build a final project that blends data, storytelling, and design around topics I care about, such as travel, food, and digital culture.</p>
            <p>Each page represents a different lab assignment, building from foundational web development skills to data visualization and interactive mapping.</p>

        <!-- This Welcome section introduces the purpose of my portfolio.
        I want visitors to quickly understand what this site is for and what kind of
        projects they can expect to see throughout the semester. -->

<!-- I updated the color palette to include Mother Earth (#513229), Lucky Dice (#f4f1e2),
Something Blue (#d8ebf9), The Bay (#fce6b7), and Walking Vinnie (#d7d4b1).
These colors were chosen to create a warm, earthy, film-like, and vintage tone that
reflects my interests in travel, culture, photography, and nostalgic storytelling. -->

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> Hi! I’m Zoe Nguyen, a senior majoring in Strategic Communication with a minor in Digital Culture & Data Analytics. I’m interested in how culture, media, and data intersect in digital spaces. One fun fact about me: I love documenting travel and everyday moments through food photos, cafe hopping, and short-form digital storytelling.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I’m excited by questions around digital culture, social media, identity, and how people make meaning online. I’m especially drawn to projects involving travel, food, music, and visual storytelling, as well as how platforms shape community and representation.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> From this course, I hope to strengthen my data analytics and technical skills, especially using tools like Python, data visualization, and web-based storytelling to better support creative, culture-focused projects. I want to become more confident translating ideas into data-driven digital work and building a portfolio that reflects both analytical and creative thinking.</p>
            <!-- I wrote a personalized "About Me" section instead of using placeholder text.
            This section helps visitors learn who I am, what I study, and my interests in
            travel, food, culture, and digital storytelling. -->

            <!-- Optional: Add a photo of yourself -->
             <!-- I replaced the placeholder image with a personal photo taken in Da Lat, Vietnam.
            This image represents my home country and reflects my interests in travel, culture,
            and photography, which are central themes in my work and identity. -->

            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> So far, I’ve learned how to set up a GitHub portfolio and understand the basic structure of a website using HTML and CSS. I also gained a better sense of how design choices—like layout, images, and color palettes—can communicate personal identity and project goals. For example, experimenting with color palettes helped me think more
intentionally about how visual design can communicate mood, narrative, and identity
in a digital portfolio.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> One challenge was troubleshooting why my CSS changes were not appearing on the live GitHub site. Through this, I learned about file paths, caching, and the importance of committing and pushing changes correctly. While technical details can feel intimidating, working through them helped me feel more confident navigating web-based tools.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
